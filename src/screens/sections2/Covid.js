                    COVID-19 has - and will continue to have - an unprecedented
                    impact on Creative Power Organisation. Support systems that
                    were already overtaxed are being pushed beyond their limit.
                    Young people have restricted access to community supports.
                    Some are stuck in homes that are unsafe, while others donâ€™t
                    have a space to call home. Many are navigating unemployment
                    and the financial fallout of the pandemic. We're working
                    around the clock to make sure young people have the
                    education, resources, and community they need right now in
                    order to look out for their own mental health and that of
                    their peers.
